# Pool Simulator in Java

A Java application that simulates the movement of a ball on a pool table. It offers two different physics simulations: Simple and Newtonian. The code is designed with object-oriented principles, abstraction, and end-to-end testing in mind.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: The application is structured using classes and inheritance, providing a clean, modular codebase.

- **Physics Models**:
  - **Simple Physics**: Basic linear motion without considering forces such as friction or collision effects.
  - **Newtonian Physics**: Takes into account forces, frictions, and more detailed collision effects for a more realistic simulation.

- **Abstraction**: The application uses abstract classes and interfaces to provide a clear separation of concerns and easy scalability.

- **End-to-End Testing**: Comprehensive testing suite to ensure the simulator works as expected.
